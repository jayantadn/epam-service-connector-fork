"""HVAC ECU service.

Consumes the host dashboard's fan-speed command over Zenoh, writes it
directly into the shared Kuksa Databroker on the primary node, and sends
status updates back to the dashboard's indicator panel.

Connectivity: runs as a Zenoh *client* that dials the router on the
primary node (no inbound listener), and a Kuksa gRPC client pointed at
the single broker. The service is stateless and may migrate between
nodes; both endpoints are fixed on the primary node, so its current
node does not matter.
