# Eclipse SDV Blueprint — Hybrid Cloud–Edge Application Lifecycle Management

This blueprint demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for developing, validating and orchestrating Mixed-Critical Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) applications across cloud and HPC edge device.

It showcases how SDV applications are developed in the Playground Digital Auto Portal using the C++ and Python platforms, pushed to AosEdge registry, and deployed onto an in-vehicle HPC running AosCore software package. In the updated architecture, the AutoWorx Runtime is replaced by the Syncer, KUKSA Bridge, and Zenoh protocol, while Eclipse KUKSA remains a core component. Vehicle signals are exchanged across heterogeneous compute domains with HPCs, Zonal and End ECUs — through Eclipse SCore and Eclipse Zenoh.

## Demonstrated Use Case – EV Range Extender

Software defined Application  **EV Range Extender**.

The EV Range Extender application continuously monitors the vehicle's battery State of Charge (SoC). When the SoC drops below a predefined threshold, the application initiates a power-saving mode by identifying and reducing or disabling non-essential functions, such as HVAC climate control and seat heating, while maintaining all critical driving and safety functions.

### Use Case Flow

The table below shows how the EV Range Extender application monitors the battery State of Charge (SoC), evaluates vehicle functions, and automatically activates power-saving measures when required.

| | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Who** | EV Range Extender | EV Range Extender | Driver |
| **What** | Continuosly Monitors the Vehicle battery (State of Charge), and it drops below the predefined critical threshold. | EV Range Extender app automatically enters power-saving mode and instantly scaling down non-essential features (HVAC climate control, seat heating). | The EV Range Extender optimises energy consumption to extend the vehicle's driving range, while notifying the driver of the actions performed. |
| **Customer TouchPoints** | None | Cabin environment (HVAC eases off, seat heater turns off) | "Power Saving Mode" activated and Driving Range extended |


> **Why this matters for OEMs:** Unlike a manual "Eco Mode" button, the EV Range Extender showcases how SDV applications can continuously monitor vehicle conditions, make intelligent decisions, and automatically optimise energy usage to extend driving range while maintaining safety and enhancing the driver experience

###  VSS signal used in the EV Range Extender sdv application

| Infrastructure Layer | VSS Signal | Vehicle Functions Layer | Functionality of the signal |
|----|---|---|---|
| VM1      | `Vehicle.Powertrain.TractionBattery.StateOfCharge.Current` |  BMS | Triggers power-saving mode when charge is low |
| VM1	   |  `Vehicle.Powertrain.TractionBattery.CurrentVoltage` |  BMS | Battery voltage monitored by the Battery Monitoring System |
| VM1	   |  `Vehicle.Powertrain.TractionBattery.CurrentCurrent` |  BMS | Battery current monitored by the Battery Monitoring System |
| VM2      | `Vehicle.Cabin.HVAC.AmbientAirTemperature` |  HVAC ECU | Adjusted to save power and bridged to VM1 |
| VM2      | `Vehicle.Cabin.Seat.Row1.DriverSide.Heating` |  Seat ECU | Disabled to save power and bridged to VM1 |

| VM2      | `Vehicle.Cabin.Seat.Row1.DriverSide.HeatingCooling` |  Seat ECU | Disabled to save power and bridged to VM2 |

## SDV Application on digital.auto playground portal

We can develop and test the SDV application directly in the digital.auto Playground portal without requiring any hardware-specific knowledge. The dashboard provides a visual interface to demonstrate and validate the application’s functionality, enabling rapid development and evaluation in a simulated environment.

 **[Open Application on digital.auto Playground](https://playground.digital.auto/model/67f76c0d8c609a0027662a69/library/prototype/69ce30f438bb8e98f0af5ac8/code)**

The digital.auto Playground enables you to simulate vehicle signals and observe the application's behaviour in a virtual environment before deploying it to real hardware. This allows OEMs to validate business logic, verify signal interactions, and refine the end-to-end customer experience through rapid testing and iteration.

---

## Architecture Overview

The blueprint is implemented in two phases. 

**Phase 1** Leverages virtual machines, enabling teams to develop, test, and validate functionality without relying on physical hardware. 

**Phase 2** Transitions the solution to production-grade automotive hardware, enabling validation under real-world conditions and ensuring readiness for deployment. While the edge hardware is replaced with automotive-grade devices, the cloud infrastructure, application logic, and interfaces remain unchanged across both phases, providing a seamless path from development to production

---

## Phase 1 — Virtual Machines

![Architecture Phase 1](./images/architecture_phase1.svg)

Phase 1 is designed for rapid application development and validation. By running the full stack in QEMU-based virtual machines, developers can build, test, and refine functionality on standard computing platforms before moving to automotive hardware. This software-defined environment accelerates innovation while reducing dependency on physical devices.

### System Setup Workflow

The following section describes the end-to-end setup required to recreate the Phase 1 demo from scratch. It is organized into sub-sections that guide the VM setup and deployment flow in a practical sequence.

- [Chapter 1 — VM setup and deployment flow](#chapter-1--vm-setup-and-deployment-flow)
- [Chapter 2 — OEM and service deployment setup on AOS Edge](#chapter-2--oem-and-service-deployment-setup-on-aos-edge)
- [Chapter 3 — Build and deploy the SDV application](#chapter-3--build-and-deploy-the-sdv-application)
- [Chapter 4 — Run the demonstration](#chapter-4--run-the-demonstration)

#### Automated setup

tbd

#### Manual setup

##### Chapter 1 — VM setup and deployment flow

**Prepare the VM environment**
- Download the latest AOS VM image package of bosch and provisioning script from the AOS Edge meta-aos-vm release page: [meta-aos-vm releases](https://github.com/aosedge/meta-aos-vm/releases/)
- Extract the image archive and start the QEMU-based VMs from the same directory:

```bash
tar -xvf aos-vm-image-genericx86-64-6.1.0-bosch.2.tar.xz
sudo ./aos_vm.sh run -f .
```
- Access the primary node with `ssh root@10.0.0.100` and the secondary node with `ssh root@10.0.0.x`, where the address can be discovered with:

```bash
ip neigh
```
- Monitor the boot and service logs with:

```bash
journalctl -f
```
- Provision the primary VM to AOS Cloud with:

```bash
aos-prov provision -u 10.0.0.100
```

**Install the required software layer**
- Download the AOS VM layers package from the same release page: [aos-vm layers package](https://github.com/aosedge/meta-aos-vm/releases/download/v6.1.0-bosch.2/aos-vm-layers-genericx86-64-6.1.0-bosch.2.tar.gz)
- Extract the archive and publish the layers using the signing flow:

```bash
tar -xvf aos-vm-layers-genericx86-64-6.1.0-bosch.2.tar.gz
aos-signer go
```
- After the publish step, verify in the AOS Cloud Service Provider portal that the expected layers are available in the Layers section. The layers that should appear are `kuksa-client`, `zenoh`, and `pylibs`.
- Confirm that the uploaded layer is available for the target units and that it can be pulled by the VM.

**Deploy the demo services**
- Clone or access the demo-services repository from [demo-services](https://github.com/aosedge/demo-services.git).
- The demo-services repository contains the deployment bundles for the EV Range Extender use case: `bms`, `range-ai`, `seat-ecu`, and `hvac`.
- In the VM, navigate to the EV Range Extender service directory and package it for deployment:

```bash
cd /path/to/demo-services/ev-range-extender
aos-signer go
```
- Confirm that these application are then downloaded by the target VM after the cloud-side deployment is configured.

##### Chapter 2 — OEM and service deployment setup on AOS Edge

**Configure the OEM target systems**
- Open the AOS documentation portal at [AOS Edge Quick Start](https://docs.aosedge.tech/docs/quick-start/) and install the required certificates in the environment where the deployment tools are used.
- After this, create the required service and subject in the AOS dashboard so the deployment can be bound to the target VM which is followed on the aosedge quick start guide id not done .
- Sign in to the AOS Service Provider or OEM portal at [AOS Cloud](https://api.aoscloud.io/account/start) and import the required `.p12` certificate, such as `aos-user-oem.p12` or `aos-user-sp.p12`.
- Download the unit configuration template from [unitconfig.json](https://github.com/aosedge/meta-aos-vm/releases/download/v6.1.0-bosch.2/unitconfig.json) and import it in AosEdge Dashboard →Target System →edit →UNIT CONFIG
- Create the unit set `Unitset_Bosch` and assign it to the provisioned VM so verification does not block the demo deployment.
  - Configure: Title `Unitset_Bosch`, Description `Optional`, Update Strategy `Minimize Unit Restart`, and enable `Is Verification Set`.
  - Save the unit set, then open the target VM in AosEdge Dashboard → Units, select its details, and add `Unitset_Bosch` under Manage Unit Sets.
- After this, create the required service and subject in the AOS dashboard so the deployment can be bound to the target VM.
  - Create the service from the Services section to define the software package to deploy.

**Steps to Create a Service**

1. Open the **Services** page.
2. Click **Add Service**.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Title:** `NUC service`
   - **Codename:** `f28be5f0-3b9c-4f99-84ba-875cc18f5def` (auto-generated)
   - **Description:** `Service for NUC box`
4. Configure the **Default Quotas**:
   - **CPU DMIPS:** `10000`
   - **RAM:** `97656.25 KiB`
   - **Process Limits (Optional):**
     - **PIDs:** Leave blank (default)
     - **nofile:** Leave blank (default)
   - **Storage Limits:**
     - **Storage:** `19531.25 KiB`
     - **State:** `500000 B`
     - **tmp:** `200000 B`
5. Review the configuration.
6. Click **Create** (or **Save**) to register the service.

  - Create the subject under Subjects, attach the target VM, and bind the service to it.
- Follow the [AOS Edge Quick Start guide](https://docs.aosedge.tech/docs/quick-start/) if you need help with these steps.

**Approve and bind the service**
- In AosEdge Dashboard → SOTA/FOTA → Verification Batches, open the package and approve it for deployment.
- In AosEdge Dashboard → SOTA/FOTA → Deployment Bundles, confirm that the package is validated and available.
- Observe the deployment process with `journalctl -f` on the VM and confirm that the service starts successfully.

##### Chapter 3 — Build and deploy the SDV application

- Sign in to the digital.auto Playground at [playground.digital.auto](https://playground.digital.auto).
- Open the EV Range Extender application from the playground at [this link](https://playground.digital.auto/model/67f76c0d8c609a0027662a69/library/prototype/69ce30f438bb8e98f0af5ac8/view).
- In the AOS Cloud Deployment view, first choose the C++ option, then select the EV Range Extender application from the dropdown menu, upload the required certificate, and click Build and Deploy.
- Complete the post-deployment validation steps to ensure the application layer is available and the service is bound to the target unit.

##### Chapter 4 — Run the demonstration
- Start the hardware simulator from the repository by installing dependencies and launching the simulator:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r hardware-sim/requirements.txt
./hardware-sim/setup.sh
python hardware-sim/pytk_hwsim.py
```
- If the simulator window does not appear correctly, relaunch the script.
- Start the playground application, then click Start in the simulator to begin the battery-discharge flow.
- Monitor the runtime logs on VM1 with:

```bash
ssh root@10.0.0.100
journalctl -f | grep "range-ext"
```
- Observe the expected threshold behavior at 50% and 30% battery charge and verify the corresponding HVAC and seat-control actions.



### Steps to demo
1. Complete the "SDV-Application-Compilation-and-Configuration" steps
1. Start the hardware simulator.
2. Once the hardware simulator is running, launch the Playground application (SDV application).
3. Click the Start button in the hardware simulator to begin battery discharge simulation.

### Observe the threshold-based behaviour:
1. When the battery level reaches 50%, the HVAC fan is automatically turned off.
2. When the battery level reaches 30%, additional power-saving measures are applied, and the seat heating/cooling functions are turned off.
3. When the HVAC fan is turned off, a slight increase in the estimated driving range can be observed.
4. When the seat heating/cooling functions are also disabled, the estimated driving range increases furthe
5. Log in to QEMU-VM-1 using SSH:

```bash
ssh root@10.0.0.100
```
6. Monitor the application logs by running:

```bash
journalctl -f | grep "range-ext"
```
7. Check the application level logs

### Signal Flow and Internals

The demo runs as a closed loop across host, virtual machines, and the playground runtime.

1. **Hardware simulator (host side)** publishes battery and cabin control values.
2. **QEMU-VM-1 runtime stack** receives battery values and updates the vehicle signal broker.
3. **Vehicle signal broker (Kuksa)** stores and distributes current vehicle values used by the application and runtime services.
4. **Bridge layer** transfers cabin-related signal and  updates between QEMU-VM-1 and QEMU-VM-2 so both compute domains stay synchronized.
5. **VM2 ECU services** apply HVAC and seat actions and publish actuator status back to the dashboard.

## Phase 2 — Physical Hardware

![Architecture Phase 2](./images/architecture_phase2.svg)

Phase 2 replaces the virtual machines with **automotive hardware**. The cloud layer and application logic stay identical — this phase validates that the same software runs correctly on the hardware an OEM would actually put in a vehicle.

A key addition in Phase 2 is the **End ECU layer** (STM32), which represents the deepest level of the vehicle's electrical architecture — the microcontrollers directly attached to physical sensors and actuators like motors, lights, and HVAC.

### How the flow works

```
1. Same cloud flow as Phase 1 (AosCloud → App Registry → App Fetching)
        ↓
2. App runs on a NXP S32G2 board (automotive-grade processor)
        ↓
3. HPC communicates with Zonal Raspberry Pi over eclipse-score / SOME-IP
        ↓
4. Zonal Pi communicates with End STM32 microcontroller over eclipse-zenoh
        ↓
5. STM32 directly controls HVAC, infotainment display, seat ventilation
```

### What's running in each layer

| Layer | Hardware | Software | What It Does |
|---|---|---|---|
|  **AosCloud** | — | Fleet Management + App Registry | Same as Phase 1 |
|  **HPC** | NXP S32G2 | AosCore + digital.auto + `eclipse-autosd` | Automotive-grade compute, runs the main app logic |
|  **Zonal** | Raspberry Pi | Linux + Eclipse AutoWorx stack | Bridges HPC signals to physical ECU layer |
|  **End ECU** | STM32 | `eclipse-threadX` | Directly controls physical actuators (HVAC, lights, display) |
|  **HPC ↔ Zonal** | — | Eclipse SCore / SOME-IP | Standard automotive bus protocol |
|  **Zonal ↔ End** | — | Eclipse Zenoh | Lightweight pub/sub messaging for constrained devices |

### Additional signals unlocked in Phase 2

| Signal | Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Vehicle.Cabin.HVAC.TargetTemperature` | End ECU | Adjust climate control for power saving |
| `Vehicle.Infotainment.Display.Brightness` | End ECU | Dim screen to reduce power draw |
| `Vehicle.Cabin.Seat.Ventilation.Level` | End ECU | Disable seat ventilation |

> **For OEMs:** Phase 2 is where you validate that the app behaviour confirmed in the Playground and Phase 1 translates faithfully onto your target hardware. The signal list above represents exactly the vehicle capabilities your app will control in a real car.

### Additional Eclipse components inside the blueprint phase 2

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| `eclipse-autosd` | Automotive grade Linux OS from RedHat |
| `eclipse-zenoh` | Modern communication protocol designed for SDV |
| `eclipse-threadx` | Safe RTOS for microcontrollers |

---

## Phase Comparison

| | Phase 1 | Phase 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Develop & validate logic | Validate on real hardware |
| **HPC** | Linux VM (QEMU) | NXP S32G2 |
| **Zonal** | Not present | Raspberry Pi |
| **End ECU** | Linux VM (QEMU) | STM32 |
| **HPC ↔ End comms** | Eclipse Zenoh | — |
| **HPC ↔ Zonal comms** | — | Eclipse SCore / SOME-IP |
| **Zonal ↔ End comms** | — | Eclipse Zenoh |
| **Setup complexity** | Low — just Docker | Requires hardware |
| **Best for** | App development, signal testing, OEM demos | Pre-production validation |
