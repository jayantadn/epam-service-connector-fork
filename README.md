# Introduction

This guidance aim to setup a serivce on EPAM unit to receive python code from playground.digital.auto and execute code.

## Folder struture
```bash
- kuksa                         // this folder for KUKSA data broker
    - databroker-amd64          // bin file for amd
    - databroker-arm64          // bin file for arm
    - vss.json                  // covesa API definition
- python-packages               // this folder contain all require pytho libs
    -
    -
- service                       // this folder for the connector service
    - meta
        - config.yaml
    - src
        - app
            - syncer.py             // this is the main app to connect between unit and plsyground.digital.auto.
            - ...
- run.sh                        // this is a temporary solution to execute KUKSA and service manually while waiting for layer and service developement
```

# Installation

## Step 1: Create unit and service on AOS Edge website
[How to](https://docs.aosedge.tech/docs/quick-start/)

Output: you will get a `service ID`

## Step 2: 
Go to file: service/meta/config.yaml, line 19, change `service_id` to `service ID`

## Step 3
Go to file: service/src/app/syncer.py, line 25, change DEFAULT_RUNTIME_NAME = 'EPAM-SERVICE-001' to a another unique name.
```python
# set a secret name
DEFAULT_RUNTIME_NAME = 'EPAM-ANHB-81'
```

## Step 4: sign and publish your service
```bash
cd service
aos-signer sign
aos-signer upload
```

Then wait for service deploy to unit. It take a few minutes.

# Step 5: Test with existing prototype
Go to playground.digital.auto perform below action:
1. Register and Login(if you don't have account yet)
2. Test with existing prototype.
   2.1 Goto this prototype:
   https://playground.digital.auto/model/67d275636e5b6c002746bf4f/library/prototype/6810400bf7ffb78147e4a882/code

   2.2 Expand terminal panel

   2.3 Click 'Add runtime' (only do this action one time)
    ![image](https://bewebstudio.digitalauto.tech/data/projects/ih1XKDE24yRM/add_runtime.png)

   2.4 Enter your runtime name, format: Runtime-{your_unique runtime name}
    => As above config: it is: `Runtime-EPAM-ANHB-81`, then click add and close dialog.

   2.5 When the runtime list reload, pick your runtime. Then click run button to execute the code on aos unit.
   2.6 Switch to dashboard to see the result.
   
# Step 6: Test with your own prototype   
1. Create e vehicle model(if you don't have any) with VSS v4.1
2. Create a prototype
3. Go to tab Code: learn from step 5 code, modify it for your purpose
4. Execute new code with your runtime selected
